Answer the following questions:

I used code from Nat Tuck's lectures in order to complete this
assignment.

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
events-spa.frankpizz10.net


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

There is significant functionality including the ability to login,
logout, add new users, and add new posts. The forms are completed
for responses and comments.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

My app is not properly deployed. I included all my nginx config files
along with deploy and start scripts in my github.
